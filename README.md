# CS-300-Project-One
# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
## For project one we were required to use non-coding methodologies to evaluate different data structures such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. This project also implemented a runtime analysis that helped in our design of choosing the best data structure to use. In project two we were required to take our chosen data structure from project one and design a code to address the ABCU advisors requirements. The code was to alphabetically sort a list of courses, print them, and be able to search through them for information and prerequisites for each course.
#	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
## I approached the problem by trying to figure out the best data structure for this particular project. It is important to understand the data structure so that you can have the most efficient program. Each data structure has its own capabilities and limitations so knowing which one to use can greatly impact your project.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
## To overcome roadblocks I utilized teaching materials such as Zybooks, and previous projects to help develop my code. I also used YouTube to help explain parts of the data structure I was unsure about.
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
## I was able to learn a lot about C++ and data structures that I had never used before. I can now determine different data structures and understand when and how to use them. I also learned a lot about errors and debugging.
#	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
## The projects helped me to better my code by allowing me to find a way to write it in a more understandable way. I got better at commenting on my code throughout the course which is something I didnâ€™t do enough of starting out.
