# CS-300 Project One: Data Structures and Software Design

## Overview
In **CS-300 Project One**, the focus was on evaluating different data structures such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees through non-coding methodologies. This evaluation included a **runtime analysis** to guide the selection of the most efficient data structure for the requirements. The subsequent **Project Two** implemented the chosen data structure to meet the **ABCU advisor's requirements**, which involved:
- Alphabetically sorting a list of courses.
- Printing the sorted list.
- Searching for specific courses to retrieve their details, including prerequisites.

## Problem-Solving Process
### What Problem Were You Solving?
- **Project One**: Evaluate the efficiency and appropriateness of different data structures for the given requirements without directly coding.
- **Project Two**: Implement a program that:
  - Alphabetically sorts course data.
  - Displays the course list.
  - Allows for searching courses to view details and prerequisites.

### Why Are Data Structures Important?
Understanding data structures is crucial because each has unique characteristics that impact the efficiency of a program. Choosing the right data structure can:
- Optimize runtime performance.
- Simplify implementation.
- Ensure scalability for larger datasets.

## Approach to the Problem
### Evaluation and Selection
1. **Analyzed Requirements**:
   - Alphabetical sorting.
   - Efficient searching.
   - Handling of course details, including prerequisites.
2. **Compared Data Structures**:
   - **Vectors**: Simple and efficient for small datasets but less optimal for frequent searches or insertions.
   - **Hash Tables**: Fast searching and insertion but lack inherent sorting.
   - **Binary Search Trees**: Optimal for scenarios that required both sorting and efficient searching.

### Implementation in Project Two
- Chose a **hash table** for its efficiency in searching.
- Enhanced functionality by sorting the data before display.

## Overcoming Challenges
### Roadblocks
1. Understanding the nuances of hash tables and linked lists.
2. Debugging issues related to input parsing and edge cases.

### Solutions
- Used **course materials (Zybooks)** and **previous projects** for reference.
- Leveraged external resources like **YouTube tutorials** for additional clarity on data structures and their applications.
- Adopted a step-by-step debugging process to identify and resolve errors.

---

## Skills and Lessons Learned
### Software Design and Program Development
- Gained proficiency in C++ and foundational data structures.
- Developed a structured approach to evaluate and implement the most suitable data structure for specific requirements.

### Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
- Improved code readability through consistent use of comments and logical structuring.
- Focused on writing modular code to ensure maintainability and adaptability for future enhancements.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Data structures are not one-size-fits-all; understanding their strengths and limitations is vital for efficient software design.
- Writing clean, well-documented code is as important as achieving functionality, as it aids in long-term maintenance and collaboration.
- Leveraging multiple resources (e.g., course materials, tutorials) is essential for overcoming technical challenges and expanding knowledge.

## Final Reflection
The work on these projects has enhanced my understanding of **data structures** and **software engineering principles**, equipping me with the tools to write efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.
